## Contributing

* Discuss topic with group during regular developer meeting or open a GitHub issue to begin discussion
* If discussed during the meeting, someone on the team should capture notes in a GitHub issue discussion and supply a few code examples for further "offline" discussion
* The developer responsible for the topic creates a pull request to this repo with changes or additions reflecting the consensus of the group

## Guiding Principals

We use these as a lens with which to examine potential best practices:

* **Elegance** - We design and build beautifully elegant applications and websites, this beauty should extend to the codebase as well.
* **Speed** - We move quickly. We hit our milestones. We ship.
* **Pragmatism** - We are pragmatic in our solutions. We don't over-engineer things. No reinventing the wheel. No [yak shaving](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving).
* **Maintainability** - We maintain relationships with projects over years. This means we write maintainable code: well organized, well documented, well supported.
* **Innovation** - We look for opportunities to experiment with emerging technologies and techniques. We learn.

Also see the [Pragmatic Programmer Quick Reference Guide](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lieber/courses/csg110/sp08/Pragmatic%20Quick%20Reference.htm) for additional rules to code by.
